# Day 1 - Understanding Basics and Installing the Tools 
First of all welcome everyone who has taken this pathway! Before getting started the traditional way, Let's first understand the terms used in Full Stack and understand a few basics before getting started.<br>
 The first day itself might seem long, but bear with us a little. It's not that hard.

<br>

1. What is web development: How websites work, front-end vs back-end ?<br>
   * How do websites work?<br>All websites, at their most basic, are just a bunch of files that are stored on a computer called a server. This server is connected to the internet. You can then load that website through a browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) on your computer or your phone. Your browser is also called the client in this situation.<br>Anything that you can access in your browser is something that a web developer built. Some examples are small business websites and blogs on the simpler side, all the way up to very complex web apps like AirBnb, Facebook and Twitter.
   <br>


   * What‚Äôs the difference between front-end and back-end?<br>
   Front end‚Äù means that you‚Äôre dealing mainly with the client side. It‚Äôs called the ‚Äúfront end‚Äù because it‚Äôs what you can see in the browser. Conversely, the ‚Äúback end‚Äù is the part of the website that you can‚Äôt really see, but it handles a lot of the logic and functionality that is necessary for everything to work.

2. Basic front-end<br>
   * HTML<br>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of all websites. It‚Äôs the main file type that is loaded in your browser when you look at a website. The HTML file contains all the content on the page, and it uses tags to denote different types of content.
   <br>

   * CSS<br>
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, lets you style that HTML content so it looks nice and fancy. You can add colors, custom fonts, and layout the elements of your website however you want them to look. You can even create animations and shapes with CSS!

   * JavaScript<br>
JavaScript is a programming language that was designed to run in the browser. Using JavaScript, you can make your website dynamic, meaning it will respond to different inputs from the user, or other sources.

3. Basic back-end<br>
  * The core concern of back-end developers is creating applications that can find and deliver data to the front end.<br>
  * Many of them use reliable enterprise-level databases like Oracle, Teradata, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, EnterpriseDB and SAP Sybase ASE. There‚Äôs also a number of other popular databases including MySQL, NoSQL and PostgreSQL.



Now that we understand the term "Full Stack better", here's a link to one of the best resources out there to understand each and every term that will be used in Web Development. [Link](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_http.asp)

Once done with giving all of that ‚òùüèº a read. Let's talk about the IDE we will use..

- [Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Single handedly the best code editor, does not need extra setup for handling front end at all. You are free to use Sublime Text OR any other code editor for that matter too. Given that we will be focusing on the languages, IDE's wont really matter.



<br>
<br>

# Day 2 to 20  - HTML AND CSS

I feel one of the best ways to learn coding languages is to rather do the implementation side by side with learning rather than just reading it like high school biology. Let's get started without wasting any time. 

- [HTML Full Course - Building a website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbnSe1qUNMG7AbPmjIG54u88&index=3)- 2 Hours<br>
This course is great for starting, it's easy its simple. Also don't rush to understand things in one go. The next video is of 11 Hours that will definitely cover everything. I would request you'll to just treat this as a video lessons and remember the things your do not  understand. The next video definitely will help you to clear your doubts.
<br> 

- [Learn HTML5 AND CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU6anWqZJcc&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbnSe1qUNMG7AbPmjIG54u88&index=1)- 11 Hours<br> Amazing amazing..... Literally Freecodecamp is better than anything else out there in a few courses, WebDev is definitely one of them.<br>
This course starts from the very basics to installing vscode, using and leveraging inspect element tool. 11 Hours for this is worth it. 

- [Introduction To Responsive Web Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvUrASNj0s)- 4 Hours<br> Responsive design with HTML AND CSS.

<br>

### Schedule

Given that there is no fixed way that one might use the above links let's sort the schedule part for you. We have 8 days in total. (It was supposed to be 7 but we value your precious **Sunday** üòâ).


**For Beginners** (Using All 3 links)

So we have a lot to work with... yeah? Here...we are planning to utilize 2 hours from your precious 24 for python. 

|   Day/Days |      Hours                         |
| -----------| -----------                        |
|  2         |   2 hours (start from 0)           |
| 3 to 8     |   2 hours each day (freecodecamp)  |
| 9 to 10    |   2 hours each for Kaggle          |

<br>
<br>

# Day 11 to 21  - SQL for DataScience
Hi! Pretty sure you are a "pythonista" now, let's tackle this SQL. 
Unlike many other pathways out there, SQL is usually placed at the last to cover and being a student myself I am pretty sure if SQL is done in the last days.... Nobody would want to do it.
Why should we tackle it AND **Why 10 days for SQL?** and get it done with? 
- It's easy.
- It's super easy
- It's a must if you want to be a Data Scientist

Now SQL is very important when it comes to handling data and with analysis. Below are the links that you will surely help and set you on the path to master SQL

- [SQL from the start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY) - 4 hours <br>
Beginners... This is right where you should start.
- [Querying and managing data](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#sql-basics)<br>
This is Khan Academy's finest. There are practice tests... Go and ace it!
- [SQL Tutorial for Data Analysis](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/)<br> **Note**: This is the most important of the lot, as we have just 100 Days, we need to know what a particular topic is and what it is used for in a certain area. Here, we are focusing on **SQL for Data Science**. This link has 3 subparts (basic, intermediate, advanced). Check the image below.
![pic](/sqltut.png)
<br>

### Schedule

We have the materials now and let's look over the schedule.
The schedule is being provided for beginners the ones who are already feeling confident on the topics do not go easy on yourself. A little revision would not hurt. **100days** üî•
<br>

|  Day/Days        |  Hours                                        |
| -----------      | ----------------                              |
| 11-12            | 2 hours each (Sql From start)                 |
| 13-18            | 2 hours each (SQL Tutorial for Data Analysis) |
| 19-20 (Optional) | Querying and managing data                    |

<br>
Now the last is optional if you can complete the rest in time. 

<br>
<br>

# Day 22 to 25  - Statistics for DataScience
Okay...Now you might be thinking what in the world is going ... SQL then Stats!.... **lemme tell you from my experience of two specializations and a ton of courses.** "STATS IS GOD". You heard me right it's way important to understand the use of statistics in data science and why it is important. 

If you are getting started with stats for data science here is a great article to just read about the use of stats and the various approaches. [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/statistics-for-data-science/).

Now let's start with the videos that will surely help you get started ->
- [Stats-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua-CiDNNj30&list=PLWKjhJtqVAblQe2CCWqV4Zy3LY01Z8aF1&index=1&t=17043s) - 1 Hour<br>
This directly starts from 4th hour of the video which is 6 hours long as we only need to focus on the stats part. 
- [Stats-2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfo5le26IhY) - 7 Hours<br>
This amazing 7-hour course is taught by PhD from Stanford for FREE! I know right? This covers almost all topics to get well versed in the subject

**Remember** You will need additional resources that you find while researching on your own after you are done with 100days.
<br>

| ---------- | -----------                        |
|  22        |   2 hours (Stats-1)                |
| 23-25      | 7 hours At your own pace (Stats-2) |

<br>

# Day 26 to 35  -  PANDAS and NUMPY

If you are thinking as to "Why on earth would anyone spend the next 10 days learning two libraries?"... Then yes! About a year back, we would be on the same page..But I've realized the importance of these libraries over the course of months and how much we need it to get started with the basic analysis of data. 

Now if you have done some course on python and covered a little bit of pandas then it's great! <br>
But if you are a beginner then we have got you covered too! üòâ 

- [Numpy Official Tutorial](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/) - Several Hours (self-paced) <br>
In the quest of learning things from sources like Youtube, we often forget that almost all libraries are made to ease whole process and they are open source! This means most of the times they have their tutorials covering the whole topic from scratch. Here's a tutorial covering concepts needed for getting started with data analysis from the makers of Numpy.<br>
**Note:** When you open the next page rather than clicking on the links provided straight away, I would recommend reading everything and once you reach the end of the page they have a link to the next module. (Image below)<br>
![numpy_tut](/numpy_tut.png)

- [Numpy for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI) - 1 hour<br>
This is great for people who are getting started. Freecodecamps's course is to point and easy to understand and this should get you started.

- [Pandas Official Tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) - - Several Hours (self-paced) <br> 
Pandas is an important library when it comes to analyzing data with the help of python for data science. Mastering pandas and their features are very important. 

- [Pandas 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)- 1 Hour<br>
This video is a complete package but I do recommend using the official tutorial first then using this video as a refresher.

<br>

**These videos and links will hardly take 3-4 hours to complete so why 10 Days...? The thing with python libraries, in general, is that one needs to  practice by themselves without the help of any tutorials. Below you will find a list of exercises in python to get started with handling data in python.**

- [Pandas with Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) - 4 Hours <br>
One of the best thing about Kaggle courses is that they make sure whatever they share is focused on data science. So you don't need to worry about drifting away from the topic.<br>


### Schedule

|   Day/Days | Hours                              |
| ---------- | --------------                     |
|  26-27     |   Numpy Official Tutorial          |
|  28        |   Numpy for beginners              |
|  29-31     |   Pandas Official Tutorial         |
|  32        |   Pandas 1                         |
|  32-35     |   Pandas with Kaggle               |

<br>
<br>

# Day 36  TAKE A BREAK üòé üôåüèº

<br>
**If you feel 10 days is not enough for practising..Do not worry! Next 10 days all you'll be doing is practising Data Cleaning and Feature engineering with the help of whatever you have learned so far. This will surely help you a lot. But there's still a thing missing .... VISUALIZATIONS.... That's right. Sometimes a simple viz tells us a lot about the data and we need it while data cleaning and feature engineering.**

<br>
<br>

# Day 37 to 42 - Data Visualizations 

There are abundant viz libraries out there, but to dive into the world of viz, starting with "matplotlib" and "seaborn" is a must. 

- [Data Viz with Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas(Bonus)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPVsHOlRBBI&t=19560s)- 2 Hours<br>
This is another great video from freecodecamp and it starts from the middle of a 9 Hour long video, where we focus only on plotting with pandas and data viz with matplot and seaborn. 

- [Data Viz with Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization) - 4 Hours<br>
Now is the time to put the things you learned to the test. Exercises should get your concepts clear. What are you waiting for? Let's get started! 
<br>

- Research a little on your own.. Now this "do it by your own" you would not find much of it here but there are so so many exercises online for free ... Try it, Play with Datasets, Explore a little. Visualize! 

<br>

### Schedule

|   Day/Days | Hours                              |
| ---------- | --------------                     |
|  37        |   Data Viz with Matplotlib etc     |
|  41-42     |   Data Viz with Kaggle             |

<br>
<br>

# Day 43 to 52 - Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning 

Features found in data play a crucial role and directly influence the predictive models and the results that we need. 

Here is the link for an article that should help you understand the importance. [Click here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/)<br>

- [Feature Engineering Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering) - 6 to 8 Hours

- [Data Cleaning Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning) - 4 to 6 hours 

- [Feature Engineering by Krish Naik](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZoTAELRMXVPwYGE2PXD3x0bfKnR0cJjN)- 12-14 hours

<br>

### Schedule

|   Day/Days | Hours                              |
| ---------- | --------------                     |
|  43-46     |   Kaggle- Feature Engineering      |
|  47-48     |   Data Cleaning Kaggle             |
|  49-52     |   Feature Engineering Youtube      |


<br>


# Day 53 to 66 - Machine Learning

Now for machine learning, there are "TONS" of courses there.. Literally! But after my experience with it and doing tons of courses (both paid and unpaid), Here's a few I found that turned out to be even better than the paid ones. 

- [Intro into Machine Learning with Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)- 3 Hours

- [Machine learning CrashCourse by Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) - 15 Hours<br>
This course is one of the best ones out there for the ones learning by themselves. It has practice questions, real-world problems and viz's. Lectures from Google's researcher. 
This is not just machine learning it also covers ->
   - Problem Framing - 1 Hour
   - Data Prep       - 1.5 Hours
   - Clustering      - 4 Hours
   - Recommendation  - 4 Hours
   - Testing and debug - 4 Hours


- [Intermediate Machine learning with Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) - 4 Hours<br>
If you haven't completed google's course yet, I recommend that you complete that course first then jump onto Kaggle's Course. 


- [Scikit-Learn Course - ML with python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqNCD_5r0IU) - 2 Hours<br>
 

Now folks, do remember that we are doing this in 20 days. Now mastering this in 20 days is obviously not possible. But these two courses alone should help you understand the very basics of machine learning from scratch and especially Google's course to understand the real-world applications and dive into the world of API's because data science is not just done in jyputer notebooks. 

**The best resource out there for free is "Freecodecamp's" course on machine learning which is like a specialization of whopping 300 Hours.** Dedicating 2 hours every day..? Thats 150 days alone for machine learning. 

<br>

### Schedule

|   Day/Days | Hours                              |
| ---------- | --------------                     |
|  53        |   Intro into Machine Learning      |
|  54-60     |   ML CrashCourse by Google         |
|  61        |    Problem Framing and Data Prep   |
|  62        |     Clustering                     |
|  63        |     Recommendation Systems         |
|  64        |     Testing and Debug              |
|  65        |     Kaggle ML                      |
|  66        |    Scikit-Learn Course - ML        |

<br>
<br>


# Day 67 to 70 - Machine Learning Challenges 

Spending good 5 days to solve machine learning challenges is a great way to start. I would recommend starting with Kaggle's Titanic dataset. There are so many great notebooks using various algorithms. I would even recommend glancing thru my notebook on the dataset featuring almost all machine learning algorithms and their comparison. 

- [Titanic Overview - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- [My notebook- All algorithms](https://www.kaggle.com/utkarshxy/titanic-all-algorithms-comparison#Finally!-Models.....)

# Day 81 to 100 - Deployment and Understanding Pipelines

Now that you understand almost everything and why do we need models and you can predict stuff. But always remember Data-Science is more than just jyputer notebooks.... And deploying your models where you solve a real world problem is a skill set that is very much in demand and now also a necessity. 

Before diving into deployment let's talk a little about **data pipelines**. 
- Here's an [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/whats-data-science-pipeline/) from geeksforgeeks that neatly explains the whole concept. 

- Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9IGkBfOoic) that also talks about how to create pipelines using Sklearn. Yes! There are multiple ways of creating pipelines. 

- If this üëÜüèº does not get anything in your head then I have a few more videos...WE got you covered! [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApCQKuWqBM&t=3503s) by CodingEntrepreneurs is a classic for understanding pipelines with the help of jyputer, pandas and FastAPI.

- Now, what are API's... especially in the field of data science? [Here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/11/an-introduction-to-apis-application-programming-interfaces-5-apis-a-data-scientist-must-know/).

<br>

Once you are done with all those. Let's get back at deployment and look at some resources that can help us with deployment. Do remember, there are multiple deployment platforms and the process is not that different, its almost identical except for a few changes in steps here and there depending on the platform of choice. 

- [End to end Ml model deployment - Car prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_tpQSY1aTs&t=11s) - 1.5 Hours 
This is again a great video by Krish. Its' clean, simple and beginner-friendly.

- [Ml deployment in Google Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw6NMQrYc6w&t=3816s)
This might be a little difficult to understand by being familiar with cloud services and deployment of either Google, Amazon or Microsoft is always a plus. 

**Other ways of deployment ->**

- [Deploy Machine Learning Model using Flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrExsjcvF4o&t=1s)<br>
Flask can also be used to deploy models using products like Heroku and Docker. There are plenty of resources out there. Our main focus was to get you familiar with Deployments, API's and Pipelines. 


### Automated Data Pipeline playlist by Kaggle
This is optional but I personally recommend this. This playlist should clear most of the doubts, If any. Here's the 
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqFaTIg4myu_SCTjwX3pfgGNjQJNJbUzT).
